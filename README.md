# Introduction
In this one the assignment is to learn about Constructors, Encapsulation, and Understanding Class Structures

## Environment Setup
- JDK (Java Development Kit) Version 23.0.2
- VSC

## The Design of my "Person" class
My class consists of the variables name, age, gender, hobby, and occupation

## Challenges
I don't really encounter a lot of challenges during my time coding this, but if i could name one, it's probably understanding Default constructor and Parameterized constructor

## What i learnt
- How to make an Structured Class
- How to make a Constructor (Default and Parameterized) and learning when to use which (Using Default when maybe there's still some stuff about the person that is Unidentified, and using Parameterized when the informations about that person is already known)
